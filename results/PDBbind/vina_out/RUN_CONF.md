## run1
first run of vina, due to errors in prep only 3015 PDBs were run out of 4650. No random seed defined.
## run2 
Same as run1 but with random seed set to 904455071.
## run3
using different conf settings:
```conf
energy_range = 5
exhaustiveness = 8
num_modes = 9
```

## run4
```conf
energy_range = 3 
exhaustiveness = 12
num_modes = 9
```

## run5
```conf
energy_range = 5
exhaustiveness = 12
num_modes = 9
```
